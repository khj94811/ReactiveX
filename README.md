# Reactive X Study

- ReactiveX is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.
- It extends the observer pattern to support sequences of data and/or events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety, concurrent data structures, and non-blocking I/O.

### Why Use Observables?

- Observables Are Composable
- Observables Are Flexible
- Observables Are Less Opinionated
